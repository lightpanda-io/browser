// Sometimes we need to extend libdom. For example, its HTMLDocument doesn't
// have a readyState. We have a couple different options, such as making the
// correction in libdom directly. Another option stems from the fact that every
// libdom node has an opaque embedder_data field. This is the struct that we
// lazily load into that field.
//
// It didn't originally start off as a collection of every single extension, but
// this quickly proved necessary, since different fields are needed on the same
// data at different levels of the prototype chain. This isn't memory efficient.

// By default, if no option is explicitly selected, the first option should
// be selected. However, libdom doesn't do this, and it sets the
// selectedIndex to -1, which is a valid value for "nothing selected".
// Therefore, when libdom says the selectedIndex == -1, we don't know if
// it means that nothing is selected, or if the first option is selected by
// default.
// There are cases where this won't work, but when selectedIndex is
// explicitly set, we set this boolean flag. Then, when we're getting then
// selectedIndex, if this flag is == false, which is to say that if
// selectedIndex hasn't been explicitly set AND if we have at least 1 option
// AND if it isn't a multi select, we can make the 1st item selected by
// default (by returning selectedIndex == 0).
