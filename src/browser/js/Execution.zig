//! Execution context for worker-compatible APIs.
//!
//! This provides a common interface for APIs that work in both Window and Worker
//! contexts. Instead of taking `*Page` (which is DOM-specific), these APIs take
//! `*Execution` which abstracts the common infrastructure.
//!
//! The bridge constructs an Execution on-the-fly from the current context,
//! whether it's a Page context or a Worker context.
